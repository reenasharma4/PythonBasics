What is Python, and why is it popular?\n","   - Python is a programming language which can be easily understand to read and write. Some other languages use punctuations but the Python use english keywords frequently. It is used in different programming fields like web developement, data analytics, artificial intelligence and machine learning.\n","\n","2. What is an interpreter in Python?\n","   -  Interpreter converts the code from high-level language code to machine level code. It reads and exceute the code line by line, so there is no need to compile the code beforehand.\n","\n","3. What are pre-defined keywords in Python?\n","   - The pre-defined keywords is a reserved words in Python that conveys a special meaning and uses to do a certain tasks. Some of the python keywords are Not, True, False, if, while, else, with, etc. These words can't be used as variable.\n","\n","4. Can keywords be used as variable names?\n","   - No, we can't use the keywords as variable names because they are reserved words which have a special meaning in Python.\n","\n","5. What is mutability in Python?\n","   - Mutability means that you can change the object after the creation. List are mutable (changable) while tuples are immutable (unchangable).\n","   \n","   \n","6. Why are lists mutable, but tuples are immutable?\n","   - List are mutable because you can add and remove the items easily but tuplese are immutable because their content can't be change after creation. d after creation, while lists are mutable and can be modified. Additionally, tuples are more memory-efficient compared to lists.\n","\n","7. What is the difference between == and is operators in Python?\n","   - The main difference between == and is operators in Python is, == operator compares whether the two values are same or not, whereas, is operator compares if the two variables are pointing the same variable in memory or not.\n","\n","8. What are logical operators in Python?\n","   - There are three logical operators in Python that allows to combine the conditions.\n","   1. And- It means, both the conditions must be true. If one of them is false, the entire result will be false.\n","   2. Or- It means, atlease one condition must be true.\n","   3. Not- It means, it will flips true to false and false to true.\n","\n","9. What is type casting in Python?\n","   - Type casting is most importance becuase it allows for flexible operations and data manipulation. It is a process of changing a variable data type from one data type to another like, changing a number into a string.\n","\n","10. What is the difference between implicit and explicit type casting?\n","    - The main difference between the implicit and explicit type casting is that implicit type casting is done automatically by Python from one data type to another while explicit type casting requires the programmer to specify the desired type functions like to change a type using int() or str().\n","\n","11. What is the purpose of conditional statements in Python?\n","    - Conditional statements in Python control the programmes by making decisions based on certain conditions. It helps the code to make more efficient and easy to read using if, elif, and else.\n","\n","12. How does the elif statement work?\n","    - Elif statement helps to check in multiple conditions after if. It runs its block if the first condition is False and the another is True.\n","\n","13. What is the difference between for and while loops?\n","    - The main difference between them is a for loop used when you know how many times to repeat a block of code, while a while loop keeps going as long as its condition is true.\n","\n","14. Describe a scenario where a while loop is more suitable than a for loop.\n","    - When we want to continue looping until the specific conditions are met, rather then specify the number of times.\n"],"metadata":{"id":"a59MZ4iGsOLz"}},{"cell_type":"code","source":["#1.
